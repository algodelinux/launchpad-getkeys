This is a modified version of launchpad-getkeys from Saurabh Kumar
(see https://github.com/sa1/launchpad-getkeys) made by Esteban M. Navas 

The changes have been merged back.

This version can use a config file /etc/default/launchpad-getkeys:
# Defaults for launchpad-getkeys

# Define a proxy server if you need to bypass a firewall to update keys
# SERVER=servidor

# Define a proxy server port if you need to bypass a firewall to update keys
# PORT=3128

# Remove expired keys:
# REMOVE_EXPIRED_KEYS=no  : don't remove expired keys (option by default)
# REMOVE_EXPIRED_KEYS=yes : remove all expired keys

If the file don't exists or proxy server is unreacheable, launchpad-getkeys will ignore it.

Usage:   

  launchpad-getkeys (as root)
  sudo launchpad-getkeys (as users with sudoers permissions)

Parameters:   

   * use without any parameter to automatically import all the missing GPG keys.
   * -k SERVER:PORT will pass a new keyserver, in case the default keyserver is down.
   * -p PROXY:PORT lets you specify a proxy-server other than the default one.
   * -r remove all expired keys.
